# Cybersecurity-Compliance-Audit-work-based-on-NIST-Framework

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we are going to walk through how to carry out a Cyber security compliance audit based on NIST Cybersecurity Framework for the organisation. We will conduct a simulation audit on Arizona Department of Homeland Security (https://azdohs.gov) as case study organisation. We will also use ISACA audit/ assurance programs to conduct the audit effectively. The audit/assurance program is built on the following five critical cybersecurity activities:  

•	Identify

•	Protect

•	Detect

•	Respond

•	Recover

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft excel </b> 
- <b>NIST Cybersecurity Framework SP 800-171 </b> 
- <b>NIST Cybersecurity Framework 800-53 </b> 
- <b>ISACA audit / assurance programs based on NIST Cybersecurity Framework </b>
- <b> [Arizona Department of Homeland Security Information Security Policies, Standards, and Procedures](https://azdohs.gov/information-security-policies-standards-and-procedures) </b> 

<h2> Cybersecurity audit </h2>

- <b> A cyber security audit is a systematic and independent examination of an organization’s cyber security.The audit ensures that the proper security controls, policies, and procedures are in place and working effectively. 

- <b> The objective of a cybersecurity audit is to provide management with an evaluation of the effectiveness of cybersecurity processes, policies, procedures, governance and other controls. The review will focus on cybersecurity standards, guidelines and procedures as well as the implementation of these controls
<br />

<h2> Methodology for the cybersecurity audit </h2>

Walkthrough: Define Audit Objective </h2>

Once what is being audited has been decided,the objective of the audit needs to be established.Why is it being audited? From an auditor’s perspective, it is advisable to adopt a risk-based approach (focusing on high risk areas) and define the objectives accordingly.

The audit objectives should be limited to a reasonable scope and should also correspond to cybersecurity and protection goals as defined by the enterprise.

 Audit Objectives for the lab </h2>
 
•	Provide management with an assessment of their cybersecurity policies and procedures and their operating effectiveness.

•	Identify security control concerns that could affect the reliability, accuracy and security of the enterprise data due to weaknesses in security controls.

•	Evaluate the effectiveness of response and recovery programs.

Walkthrough: Set Audit Scope </h2>

Once the objectives for the audit have been defined, the planning and scoping process should identify all areas and aspects of cybersecurity to be covered. In other words, what are the limits to the audit? This could include a specific country, region, division, process area or aspect of cybersecurity.This should be risk based approach .

Cybersecurity audit scopes are usually more restricted than those for general IT audits due to the higher level of complexity and technical detail to be covered. For an annual or multiyear scope, it is advisable to break down the overall scope into manageable audits and reviews, grouping them by area addressed and by approach.

Audit scope for the lab </h2>

The  scope of the audit is on focusing on five critical cybersecurity activities which are :

•	Identify

•	Protect

•	Detect

•	Respond

•	Recover

We will identify the scope of organizational systems and assets to be reviewed. 

Walkthrough: Perform Pre-Audit Planning </h2>

During risk assessment ,evaluate the cyber security risk to  determine their significance. Conducting a risk assessment is critical in setting the final scope of a risk-based audit. The more significant the risk, the greater the need for assurance.

Walkthrough: Determine Audit Procedures and Steps for Data Gathering </h2>

At this stage of the audit process, you should have enough information to identify and select the audit approach or strategy and start developing the audit program. However, the testing steps do need to be defined.

Follow the ISACA NIST CSF audit program step by step from Identifying controls to Recovery controls.

• Identify the function of the control in terms of NIST 800-53 Control for example the first control IDENTIFY (ID) control

• Understand the defined category of the control and its meaning 
(e.g Asset Management (ID.AM)): The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives and the organization’s risk strategy.

• Understand the subcategory which are mapped down to informative references as shown below :

• With reference to the organisation being audited,for each subcategory define the control type,control classifications and control frequency :

• Identify artefacts to evidence for each control for easy audit excution 

• Follow the testing procedures in the audit program 

• Document your findings / evidence 

• Document your data collection method either (Interview, Documentation or Testing)

• Make your disposition by of each control completing if the control is (In place ,partially in place or not in place).

<h2> Reporting / Conclusion </h2>

Walkthrough: Reporting </h2>
The audit report should have the following critical items :

• Executive Summary 

Report on what happened during the audit and disposition. Highlights identified biggest GAPs.

If it is a regulatory compliance audit clearly indicate that the organisation IS COMPLIANT OR NOT COMPLIANT with certain standard 

• Purpose of the audit

• Scope of the audit
